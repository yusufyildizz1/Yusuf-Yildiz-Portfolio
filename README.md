### About Me
I am an Electrical-Electronics Engineering student at Abdullah Gül University (AGU) with a specialized interest in Analog Circuit Design, Discrete Electronics, and Signal Integrity. My engineering philosophy is built on the principle of bridging the gap between complex mathematical models and robust, industrial-grade hardware.

Rather than relying solely on high-level integrated solutions, I am passionate about exploring the "physics of the circuit"—designing from the ground up using discrete components. My work involves extensive transistor-level modeling in LTSpice, where I analyze parasitic behaviors, timing constraints, and frequency responses. From designing high-precision Sallen-Key active filters to optimizing Wien Bridge oscillators, I focus on developing electronic systems that are not only functional but also optimized for reliability and cost-effectiveness in R&D environments.
